# ViTime: A Visual Intelligence-based Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting

Architecture.jpg

## Introduction

The success of large pretrained models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) has inspired new approaches for building foundation models in time series forecasting (TSF). Traditional TSF models often rely heavily on numerical data fitting. However, the human brain excels at processing visual information, predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. Mimicking this capability, we introduce ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime leverages visual data processing paradigms and an innovative data synthesis method called Real Time Series (RealTS) during training.

## Key Features

- **Visual Intelligence**: Utilizes visual data processing to enhance time series analysis and forecasting.
- **Real Time Series (RealTS)**: A novel data synthesis method improving model training and performance.
- **Zero-Shot Performance**: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting on diverse datasets, often surpassing the best supervised models.
